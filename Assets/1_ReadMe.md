Hi, Split this file up into new folders.
This is Not Actually An Assets folder as such but more of a 
Repository of .json files which will then link to various different
assets, url, images and tutorials..

End goal to make the whole Assets Folder a searchable API,
using Node.js, Bonsai elastic Search and Heroku Apps....

ideas, I'm still learn stuff so any help would be appreciated
