# Art and Coding Resources
 Resources for creativity

 The Aim of this page is to collect multiple resources, learning out-lets and assets for
people who enjoy bothcoding and artwork. This is a work in progress and hopefully will be updated
on a regular basis. Anybody is welcome to contribute, & add other resourcs.
Hopefully also build a small community of like minded people also on our DeviantArt group page,
which will allow users to chat, collaborate nd bounce ideas off one another.
